        paragraph, table, and filters) and specifies the styling in our stylesheet.

            or resize itself smoothly.
            By linking to the homepage, index.html, to reset the webpage after a

                      Are we alone in the universe? For millennia, humans have turned 
                      to the sky to answer this question. Now, thanks to research generously 
                      funded by W. Avy, a UFO-enthusiast and amateur ufologist, we can 
                      supplement our sky-searching with data analysis.<br><br>
                      "The release of this analysis is well-timed: It coincides with the 
                      celebration of World UFO Day, which is a moment for ufologists around 
                      the world to connect, relax, and sample a range of UFO-themed snacks," 
                      said Dr. Ursula F. Olivier, the world's preeminent expert on circular 
                      sightings. "Citizen-scientists can be especially helpful in both 
                      cataloguing sightings—which is hugely helpful for us in our search for 
                      aliens—and in helping us celebrate the work that has already been done, 
                      such as this data visualization project, which will help us raise 
                      awareness of the ubiquity of sightings!"<br><br>
                      Not everyone is ready to celebrate, however. Local CEO and vocal 
                      anti-alien activist V. Isualize reached out to our reporters to go on 
                      record as firmly opposed to any attempts to provide access to this data. 
                      "If there are aliens, they certainly would like to be left alone," she 
                      stated, before directing us to the Leave Aliens Alone (LAA) community 
                      engagement initiative she founded and funds.<br><br>
                      So what do YOU think? Are we alone in the universe? Are aliens trying 
                      to contact us, or do they want to be left alone? Dig through the data 
                      yourself, and let us know what you see.
